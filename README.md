# Discordeno Bot Template

You can use this template for your needs. Discordeno is like discord.js, but way less heavy on resources, and has very nice and clean syntax and features. It also has automatic sharding and upscaling in case your bot gets big.

There are some example functions and handlers and ways to do things which you may find helpful.

Make sure for everything you're using, you've got it in desiredProperties. This is a nice feature to remove unnecessary bloatware.

If you want some help or have questions, feel free to contact me on discord.

`npm install` first, then
`npm run dev` runs the bot
`npm run register` registers commands from ./src/commands folder
